# CORDIC Vectoring Mode Optimized for ARM

This project aim to optimize the CORDIC vectoring mode algorithm for ARM processors. Specifically, this project was developed on an ARMV7HL board with NEON support. The approaches taken to optimize CORDIC are detailed in "Final Report.pdf". This project was originally completed for the SENG 440 course at UVic.
